The SC-CA1 synapse and presynaptic NMDA receptors

See Figure in McGuinness et al., Presynaptic NMDARs in the Hippocampus Facilitate Transmitter Release at Theta Frequency, Neuron, 2010.

Facilitation is nonexistent at 1 Hz, strong at 5 Hz, and weak at 20 Hz.   Conditions: Black=control, Gray=NMDA receptors blocked.

Simulation results when preNMDARs were closer than VGCCs to the docked vesicle.  Conditions: Blue=control, Red=NMDA receptors blocked. 
Simulation results when preNMDARs were farther than VGCCs from the docked vesicle.   Conditions: Blue=control, Red=NMDA receptors blocked.
